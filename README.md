# Get Spotify song name

Gets name of the song and artist from Spotify URL, so you can look your favorite song up.

Doesn't use Spotify API because I don't wanna.

Astro remake of [Copy Spotify Song Name](https://github.com/suhankins/copy-spotify-song-name) that was made with Next.js.

Remade because it slightly disappointed me to see, that simpliest known to man required whole 2 MB of JavaScript.
